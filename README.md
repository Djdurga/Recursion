# Recursion


A function that call itself directly or indirectly.



Example:(Directly)


void fun1(){

...

...

fun1()

...

...

}


Applications of Recursion:

1) Many algorithm techniques are based on Recursion


        Dynamic Programming
        
        Bracktracking
        
        Divide and Conque(Binary Search, Quick Sort and Merge Sort)
        
        
2) Many problems inherently recursive


        Tower of Hanoi
        
        
        DFS based traversal(DFS of graph)
